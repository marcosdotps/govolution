## Introduction


This project shows a rotating cube using ASCII character. 

The mathematical principles to do this can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix). To sum up, we will use a rotation matix to perform a rotation in Euclidean Space. Therefore to perform a rotationon a plane point with coordinates `v=(x,y)` it should be written as a column vector and multiplied by the matix R.

A rotation matrix describes rotation about the origin and can be characterized as real square matrices whose columns and rows are orthogonal vectors with determinant 1. 

To make it easier, [symolab](https://www.symbolab.com/solver/matrix-multiply-calculator) has been used to perform matrix calculations.
